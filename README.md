### About This Project

At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with their score and the option to restart their attempt. 
This project taught me how to utilize iOS alerts within my application. 
Additionally, I expanded on my learning from _BUSN 489_ by utilizing structures in my application. 
The trickiest part of this project was the logic to auto-populate the buttons based on the question ID, as I did not initially follow good naming conventions. 
However, I figured out the logic after making my variable names more straightforward.
